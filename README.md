# ML_workshop
This repository includes the presentation and ipython files that I used for a machine learning workshop at UofA. If you have a Google account, you can access a Google Jupyter notebook hosting platform called Colab:

https://colab.research.google.com 

After clicking the above link, click on the GitHub tab on the orange bar on top. Next, copy and paste my GitHub address ( https://github.com/mohammadrashedi/ML_workshop) and press Enter. Then you will see the iPython files (Decision Trees.ipynb, KNN.ipynb, Linear models.ipynb, SVM.ipynb, and Unsupervised learning.ipynb). By clicking on each of these files, they will be opened in Colab.
